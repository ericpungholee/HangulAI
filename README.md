# HangulAI: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Korean

HangulAI is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to process and respond to Korean language queries effectively. The system combines a **retriever** and a **generator** to provide context-aware and high-quality answers to user queries. 

This project leverages **SentenceTransformers**, **Huggingface Transformers**, and **Faiss** for building an efficient and scalable pipeline.
